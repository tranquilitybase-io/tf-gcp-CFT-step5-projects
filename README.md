## Prerequisites
  
  To run the commands described in this document, you need to have the following installed:
  
  The Google Cloud SDK version 319.0.0 or later
  Terraform version 0.13.7.
  An existing project which the user has access to be used by terraform-validator.
      Note: Make sure that you use the same version of Terraform throughout this series. Otherwise, you might experience Terraform state snapshot lock errors.

   Also make sure that you've done the following:

   Set up a Google Cloud organization.
   Set up a Google Cloud billing account.
   Created Cloud Identity or Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) groups for organization and billing admins.
   Added the user who will use Terraform to the group_org_admins group. They must be in this group, or they won't have roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator access.
   For the user who will run the procedures in this document, granted the following roles:
   The roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin role on the Google Cloud organization.
   The roles/billing.admin role on the billing account.
   The roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator role.
   If other users need to be able to run these procedures, add them to the group represented by the org_project_creators variable. For more information about the permissions that are required, and the resources that          are created, see the organization bootstrap module documentation.
